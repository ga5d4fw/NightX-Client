# NightX-Client

Thank you for the past three years. This client will no longer be updated as I am leaving the community.


# Troubleshooting

If NightX fails to launch or provides an error:

- Remove all mods except for NightX to see if it's an incompatibility issue

# Configs
Loading configs is done via the command `.config onlinelist` or `.config onlineload <config_name>`
